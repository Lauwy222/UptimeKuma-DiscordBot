# Uptime Kuma X Discord

You might have wondered if there's a tool to set your service statuses in Discord, whether it's your Minecraft server or your website. There are players who are curious to see the status but are too lazy to open the URL.

You've found the tool! ðŸ˜„

As you can see in the screenshot below, the bot is able to send a message on a certain interval and edit it. With the help of a couple of emojis, it is clear for your audience if something is happening with the services.

3. **[Follow these back-end instructions](https://github.com/Lauwy222/UptimeKuma-DiscordBot/blob/main/Web/setup.md)**

## Future Plans:

We plan to implement Uptime Kuma Incidents report in a Discord Embed. Currently, it's not possible because Uptime Kuma doesn't share this data in its metrics API.

**Feel free to fork or reuse this code!**
